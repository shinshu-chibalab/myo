# MuJoCo Human Standing Optimization

## Introduction

This repository provides a simulation and optimization framework for human standing control using MuJoCo.

The framework includes:

- Human standing simulation using a musculoskeletal model
- Feedback (PD-based) control
- Feedforward muscle activation optimization
- Multi-objective optimization (e.g., NSGA-II and COMO-CMA-ES)
- Rendering of optimized motions
- Visualization of optimization results

## Running an Optimization

Example:

```bash
python standing_nsga2.py
```

or

```bash
python standing_como_cma_es.py
```

---

## Output

Optimization results are automatically saved in

```
results/
```

including:

- Pareto front
- Optimization history
- Rendered videos
- Cost history
- Optimized parameters
- Muscle activation plots

---

## Rendering

Optimized motions are rendered automatically after the optimization is completed.

Generated videos are stored in

```
results/<model_name>/videos
```

---

## Notes

- MuJoCo must be installed correctly before running the project.
- Musculoskeletal models are located in `myo_sim/`.
- To modify the simulation process, edit the files in `simulation/`.
- To implement or modify optimization algorithms, edit the files in `optim/`.
- To modify the muscle controller, edit the files in `controller/`.
- To change the objective functions, edit the files in `evaluator/`.
